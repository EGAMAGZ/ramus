**Effortlessly manage your Git branches.**

Ramus is a simple command-line tool that allows you to delete multiple Git
branches at once.

## ðŸš€ Usage

To start using Ramus, run the following command:

```bash
deno run -A jsr:@egamagz/ramus
```

Alternatively, you can install it globally with:

```bash
deno install -g jsr:@egamagz/ramus
ramus
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

While working with Git, I often accumulate a large number of branches that Iâ€™m
no longer actively using. To simplify branch management, I built Ramusâ€”a
lightweight CLI that lets you visually select and delete multiple branches in
one go.
