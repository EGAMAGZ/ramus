# ðŸŒ³ Ramus

**Effortlessly manage your Git branches.**

Ramus is a simple command-line tool that allows you to delete multiple Git
branches at once.

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the following command to start using Ramus:

```bash
deno run -A jsr:@egamagz/ramus
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

While working with Git, I often accumulate a large number of branches that Iâ€™m
no longer actively using. To simplify branch management, I built Ramusâ€”a
lightweight CLI that lets you visually select and delete multiple branches in
one go.
